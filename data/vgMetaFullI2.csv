The graphics, sound and physics engine promise to be the most realistic ever experienced in a driving simulator thanks to the new platform and the new technologies, but that alone would be a too obvious improvement: the way driving games are played also promise to undergo a revolution with Gran Turismo SPORT. This is a vision that invokes the rebirth of motorsports. The major difference between real life motorsports and Gran Turismo SPORT is in the fact that anyone, from children to the elderly, can participate and enjoy racing. Even players who have never played driving games until now can discover how fun it is to drive. Whilst at the same time, it promises the depth and complexity to meet the expectations of the existing Gran Turismo fans."
